    "prompt": "Read the passage:\n\nCity planners once treated trees as decoration, but research now highlights their practical value. Shade lowers surface temperatures, reducing energy demand for cooling. Leaves also trap airborne particles, improving air quality. Yet planting trees without considering local conditions can backfire: some species consume large amounts of water, and poorly placed roots may damage sidewalks. Effective urban forestry therefore requires careful selection and maintenance, not just enthusiasm.\n\nQuestion: What is the author's overall view of planting trees in cities?",
